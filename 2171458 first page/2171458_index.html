                        And here is where I would put an awesome web project that's been done
                        using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and ReactJS. Nice, isn't it?

                    <p>
                        As a team, we were charged with a UX makeover project for the company 'OLSoftware'
                        in less than 10 weeks we followed the (insert the name of the methodology we used, teacher
                        Solano, please spare my life) which consisted of an active communication with our project skateholders
                        and iterations of the platform that we were working on. More details coming soon.

                    <h3>Transmedia</h3>
                    <p>
                        In this project, I created a transmedia design that allowed to introduce users that don't like videogames to a comic that allowed them to
                        experience part of the main story of the project without the burning of not knowing how to play the videogame.
                        Some people don't like videogames, but they like comics. Some people don't like comics, but they are
                        interested in podcasts or other type of entertainment. With a proper transmedia diffusion, your project can
                        reach users outside your common niche.
